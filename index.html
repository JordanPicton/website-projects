            This is a portfolio site that has different websites built within, each website introduces new technologies
            to show the difference they can make to the site. I was going to use this to explain the differences for
            each website. However, I'm just going to create some random ideas for each website to show off different
            technologies rather than explain the technologies themselves. I'll have something else for that in the
            future.
